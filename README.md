## WRSPM analysis
  The University Club Phonebook is a group project aimed to help students in college access information about their club members and events. This phonebook platform will have a registration or a login page to get into the app itself. As well as, a main page where students can either add a piece of new contact information, search for someone's contact information within their own club or others, or see the entire contact list information on any club. They will also have the option of seeing the club events happening when they get into the app. By developing this phonebook platform, we aim to help students have easy access to all their club members' information, as well as the events that are happening within all clubs.

Users have access to the internet and their personal devices.
