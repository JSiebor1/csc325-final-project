//View
//The view is responsible for defining the structure, layout, and appearance of what the user sees on screen.
//Ideally, each view is defined in XAML, with a limited code-behind that does not contain business logic.
//However, in some cases, the code-behind might contain UI logic that implements visual behavior that is
//difficult to express in XAML, such as animations.
